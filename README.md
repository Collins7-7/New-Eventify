**Eventify** is a comprehensive web application designed to simplify event organization and ticket booking. Built using React for the front-end and Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL for the back-end, Eventify supports both Admin and User functionalities. 

Users can browse events and make bookings, while Admins have full CRUD access to manage events via a RESTful API. Explore the deployed app or set it up locally to experience its full features!
